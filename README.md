## Quantum Reservoir Computing
I believe that noisy random quantum sub-circuits can be trained to recognize input and output patterns for quantum circuits.

I am experimenting with this idea, but nothing to show yet. Just these links:

- [Nature article on external reservoir](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-05061-w)
